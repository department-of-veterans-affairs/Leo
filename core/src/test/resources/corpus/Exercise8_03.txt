VALVES:
4. The aortic valve appears calcified with mild stenosis. 
5. No thickening of the mitral valve is seen
6. Mild mitral valve regurgitation is noted. 
7. Tricuspid valve regurgitation, thickening, and motion all appear normal.
8. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension is present. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 51 mmHg. Estimated right atrial pressure of 15 mmHg.
8. The pulmonary valve appears normal with trace pulmonary insufficiency.

SUMMARY:
10. The study was technically limited due to patient body habitus and poor ultrasound penetration. LV Systolic function is normal with estimated EF of 60%.
