FINDINGS:

1. Views of the heart and great vessels show normal intracardiac and great vessel relationships.
2. Notable chamber enlargement and hypertrophy is present.
3. The left ventricle is mildly enlarged to 6.3 cm, wall thickness is normal, with mild global hypokinesis. Ejection fraction is estimated at 35% by M-mode and 45% by Simpson?s method.  
4. Pulmonary outflow is abnormal at the valve. 
5. Pulmonary venous return is to the left atrium. 
6. Mitral inflow and ascending aorta flow are both abnormal. With intact atrial septum.
7. The aortic valve is trileaflet. 
8. Aortic arch is left sided with normal descending aorta pulsatility. 
10. Moderate LV systolic function is noted. Ejection fraction of 30%.

SUMMARY:
Moderate left ventricular enlargement without remodeling. Moderate LV SYSTOLIC FUNCTION. Right atrium enlargement is observed on 2D Doppler views and normal vena cava. Estimated ejection fraction of 30%.
