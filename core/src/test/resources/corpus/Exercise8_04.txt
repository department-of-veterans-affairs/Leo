FINDINGS:

1. Multiple views of the heart and great vessels reveal normal intracardiac and great vessel relationships.
2. Cardiac function is normal. 
3. Significant chamber enlargement and hypertrophy is present. 
4. Pericardial effusion and vegetations are observed. 
5. Doppler interrogation, including color flow imaging, reveals systemic venous return to the right atrium with abnormal tricuspid inflow. 
6. Pulmonary outflow is abnormal at the valve. 
7. Pulmonary venous return is to the left atrium. 
8. The interatrial septum is intact. Mitral inflow and ascending aorta flow are abnormal. 
9. The aortic valve is trileaflet. 
10. The coronary arteries appear to be normal in their origins. 
11. The aortic arch is left-sided and patent with normal descending aorta pulsatility. 
12. Severly reduced LV systolic function is noted. Ejection fraction of 20%.
