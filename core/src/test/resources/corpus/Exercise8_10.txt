VALVES:
4. Mild stenosis of the aortic valve is observed with calcification. 5. No thickening of the mitral valve is seen
6. Mild mitral valve regurgitation is noted. 
7. Tricuspid valve regurgitation, thickening, and motion all appear normal.
8. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension is present. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 61 mmHg. Estimated right atrial pressure of 18 mmHg.
8. There is trace pulmonary valve insufficiency. The pulmonary valuve appears normal.
