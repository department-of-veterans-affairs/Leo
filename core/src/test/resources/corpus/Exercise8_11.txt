FINDINGS:

1. Great vessel and intracardiac relationships are normal.
2. Cardiac function is abnormal. 
3. Significant chamber enlargement and hypertrophy is present. Significant thinning of the left ventricular wall is noted. 
4. Vegitations and pericardial effusions are present.
5. Coronary arteries appear normal in origin.
6. LV systolic function is moderately reduced. Estimated ejection fraction of 25-30%.
